## 🎯 What is NodeMT5?

**NodeMT5** is an industrial-grade, type-safe Node.js client library for interacting with **MetaTrader 5** terminals via high-performance **gRPC**. It eliminates complex C++ DLL wrappers and provides direct, reliable programmatic trading.

### 🌟 Key Advantages
- 🚀 **High Throughput**: Native gRPC streaming for sub-millisecond price ticks and trade execution.
- 🛡️ **Three-Layer Architecture**: Low-level gRPC (`MT5Account`), typed wrapper methods (`MT5Service`), and high-level convenience (`MT5Sugar`).
- 🔄 **Resilient Connection**: Auto-reconnect, exponential backoff, and transparent channel healing.
- 💼 **Production Ready**: Fully verified across institutional accounts, hedge fund systems, and automated retail bots.

```
const account = new MT5Account({ user, password, server: grpcServer });
await account.connectByServerName(serverName, 'EURUSD', 30);
const summary = await account.accountSummary();
console.log(`Balance: ${summary.accountBalance}, Equity: ${summary.accountEquity}`);
```

1. Register for free at [https://mrpc.pro/signup](https://mrpc.pro/signup).
2. Generate your API token in your dashboard at [https://mrpc.pro/my](https://mrpc.pro/my).
3. Set your token in your environment or connection config.

## Step 1: Create Your Project

Create a new directory for your trading bot:

```bash
mkdir my_nodemt5_bot
cd my_nodemt5_bot
```

Install the package:

```bash
npm install @metarpc/mt5
```

## Step 2: Write Your Trading Code

Create your main application file and paste the following snippet:

```
import { MT5Account } from '@metarpc/mt5';

const account = new MT5Account({ user, password, server: grpcServer });
await account.connectByServerName(serverName, 'EURUSD', 30);
const summary = await account.accountSummary();
console.log(`Balance: ${summary.accountBalance}, Equity: ${summary.accountEquity}`);
```

## Step 3: Run the Program

Run your application:

```bash
# Verify connection output
# Balance: 10000.00, Equity: 10000.00
```
